Visualize Data with a Bar Chart
===============================
An Elm-based solution to Free Code Camp's [Visualize Data with a Bar
Chart](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart)
data visualization project.  It substitutes FDA food recall data for US gross
domestic product.

Objective
---------
Build an app that is functionally similar to this:
<https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/vGjLVZ>.

User stories
------------
1.  I can see the number of FDA food recalls initiated by companies in each
    state in the year 2016.

2.  I can mouse over a bar and see a tooltip with the number of recalls and
    state that bar represents.

The live demo can be found at <https://huggablemonad.github.io/fcc-bar-chart/>.
